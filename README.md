### This project has two parts:
- Gather player gameplay metrics with a Sourcemod plugin
- Display this information to the player through a web UI
    - Players need to authenticate with their Steam credentials in order to see their information
    - Multiple ways to manipulate the data, grouping by opponent, enemy class, weapon and so on

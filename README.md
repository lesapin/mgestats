### This project has two parts:
- 1) Gather player gameplay metrics with a Sourcemod plugin
- 2) Display this information to the players through a web UI
    -- 2.1) Players need to authenticate with their Steam credentials in order to see the information
    -- 2.2) Multiple ways to manipulate the data, grouping by opponent, enemy class, weapon and so on
